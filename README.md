Coursera Course Assignment Developing Data Products

This app is to demonstrate the limitations of linear regression when actually the underlyinng data is non-linear. We generate
the observations using a sinusoidal curve with a linear trend corrupted by random normal error terms. Three machine learning
techniques, random forest, k-nearest neighbors and gradient boosting are applied to fit the data. The root mean square error RMSE 
measurement of goodness of fit is used to determine the best fit. Plots of the data and predicted fits are given for comparison.
